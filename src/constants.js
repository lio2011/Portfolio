  pc: `This is my PC. I work mostly in JavaScript and Python these days.
      I've made a couple of games in that language. I also like C++ and Java. Anyway regardless of the language, I just like programming, I solve leetcode for fun in C++ and Python.
      Here is my leetcode profile <a href="https://leetcode.com/liam101/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>!`,
  "cs-degree": `This is my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I completed my B.Tech degree from VIT Vellore with overall 8.3 cgpa in April 2023. I hung it on the wall because I'm proud of it. It was a very theoretical degree but I think it gave me a good foundation.`,
  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here. 
    I also practice and upload my drumming clips on Instagram. Go follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/liam_crue/" target="_blank">my music page</a>! (If you like the content)`,

  bed: `This where I sleep. Great ideas comes when I'm lying on my bed. I have filed <b>2 patents</b> as a result while working at Bank of America. When an idea strikes, I often have to write it down or else I won't be able to sleep because my mental energy is consumed by it.`,

    Info about this portfolio : It's made with the Kaboom.js library which is a library for making games in JavaScript.
    Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas. Learn more about how to use
    Kaboom.js by watching some of these tutorials <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">here</a>.`,
  library: `There are a lot of books and articles on my shelves. I use them to prepare for certification exams such as my <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/215b9454-495c-48e8-804e-e2fa879d7a4a/public_url" target="_blank">Google UX Design certificate</a>. There is even one in Sanskrit (I also speak little bit Sanskrit btw :) ).
    I probably only read one of them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
